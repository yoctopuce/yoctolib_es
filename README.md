## Installation

Start by installing Node.js for your system, because you'll need it to install jspm. It's very easy, under Windows you
only have to run the installer and that's it. Make sure to install it fully, including npm, and add it to the system
path. Now, you must install jspm on the machine. You can do this very easily with an npm command:
```bash
 npm install jspm -g
```

Then, you can prepare npm and jspm to work with our EcmaScript Yoctopuce library. To do so, go to the library root
directory and run:

```bash
npm install
jspm install
```


## Running the library examples

To transpile and run with Node.JS one of the examples, you can simply use the jspm run command:

```bash
jspm run example_nodejs/Doc-Inventory/inventory.js
```


For HTML examples, it's even simpler: you only have to open the HTML file with a browser, as it is the SystemJS module
manager which loads and transpiles the code on the fly.

To avoid transpiling the library each time you run the code, because it takes a few seconds, you can ask jspm to
pre-build a bundle with the translation of all the classes and all the shims needed to run these classes.

Here is how to proceed:

```bash
jspm bundle lib/yocto_api bundles/yocto_api.js --inject
```


The module manager is then able to automatically intercept all the references to the yocto_api module and to use the
pre-transpiled bundle instead.

Finally, to make a monolithic compressed file with all the dependencies of a project, as said above, you use the
following command:

```bash
jspm bundle-sfx --minify example_html/Doc-Inventory/inventory inventory-sfx.js
```
